# Chapter 1 : Basics

## 1.2 Horizontal vs Vertical Scaling

|Horizontal|Vertical|
|-|-|
|Multiple machines|Single Huge Machine|
|Load Balancing Required|N/A|
|Resilient|Single point of failure|
|Network Calls Required|Inter process Communication|
|Data inconsistency|Consistent|
|Scales Well as Users Increase|Hardware Limit|
<br>

### *What is used in real world ?*

<br>

By using best features of horizontal and vertical scaling, we can create higly scalable systems.
